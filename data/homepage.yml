    text: "This is the fastest way to get up and surfing in North Coast with your own HD video recording of the session. Footage is crucial to any surfer learning or progressing. Professionals and beginners alike need to break down everything from their stance and the position of their feet to their style and how they are using their arms. When you surf, the whole body comes together to help you function in something referred to as style. With the footage of your lesson, not only will you have a great keepsake and momento of the day's catch, you will get to review your style and technique in the same medium used by the pros."
